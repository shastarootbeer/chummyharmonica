            <h3>I Yearn</h3>
            <p>Everyday I awake<br>
                To the same old same<br>
                I yearn for a change<br>
                For Christ's sake<br>
                Something good or something strange<br>
                I yearn for it everyday<br>
            </p>
 
            <h3>Some Year</h3>
            <p>If not this year then some year<br>
                Some year, I will find happiness<br>
                Even if it kills me<br>
                If not this year some year<br>
                Some year, I'll be content<br>
                Even if I'm an addict<br>
            </p>

            <h3>Watching Through Eyes I Have No Possession Of</h3>
            <p>I'm watching through eyes I have no possession of<br>
                I am not my body<br>
                My body is not mine<br>
                I'm just a soul<br>
                Stuck here until I'm released<br>
                By the grace of God<br>
                I'm stuck in this hell vessel<br>
                I feel like a demon sent into a pig by God<br>
                Watching through eyes I have no possession of<br>
            </p>
